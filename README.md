# Custom bash-profile PS1 prompt
Customised terminal colorized and git-aware bash profile by modifying the PS1 prompts.

Test on **MacOSX** only so far.

## Implementation
To make it work on a MacOSX, add the following line to `~/.bash_profile`
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
and restart terminal.

## Further customization
In the `~/.bash_profile`, modify the PS1 variable. There are plenty of sources on the internet on customizing the PS1 prompt to your liking.
