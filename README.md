# Custom bash-profile PS1 prompt
Customised terminal colorized and git-aware bash profile by modifying the PS1 prompts.

Tested only on **MacOSX** so far.

## Implementation
Copy the `.bashrc` to the home directory.

To make this script work on a MacOSX, add the following line to `~/.bash_profile`
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
and restart terminal.

## Further customization
In the `~/.bashrc`, modify the PS1 variable. There are plenty of sources on the internet on customizing the PS1 prompt to your liking.
